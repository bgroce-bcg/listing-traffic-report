## Overview
This feature enhances the listing print view by adding image upload functionality for property photos, implementing PDF download capability, and adding navigation from the listing detail page to the print view.

## Status
**Completed** - All sections finished

## Sections

### ✅ Section 1: image-upload-storage (Completed)
**Description:** Implement image upload functionality with Supabase Storage integration

**Files Created:**
- `/supabase/migrations/20251021000000_create_listing_images_bucket.sql` - Storage bucket creation and RLS policies
- `/lib/supabase/storage.ts` - Image upload utility functions
- `/components/listings/image-upload.tsx` - Image upload component with preview

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/listings/[id]/page.tsx` - Added ImageUpload component to listing detail page

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Supabase Storage Bucket**
   - Bucket name: `listing-images`
   - File size limit: 5MB
   - Allowed types: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
   - RLS policies: Users can only upload/update/delete their own images, public read access
   - File path structure: `{user_id}/{listing_id}/{timestamp}.{ext}`

2. **Storage Utility Functions** (`/lib/supabase/storage.ts`)
   - `uploadListingImage(listingId, file)` - Upload image with validation
   - `deleteListingImage(imagePath)` - Delete image from storage
   - `getImagePublicUrl(imagePath)` - Get public URL for image
   - Validates file type and size before upload
   - Returns public URL and storage path

3. **ImageUpload Component** (`/components/listings/image-upload.tsx`)
   - Built with shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Input)
   - Features:
     - File input with drag-and-drop (via standard file input)
     - Image preview using Next.js Image component
     - Upload progress with loading states
     - Delete functionality with confirmation
     - Client-side validation (type, size)
     - Automatic listing record update
     - Toast notifications for success/error
   - Props:
     - `listingId` - ID of the listing
     - `currentImageUrl` - Current image URL (if exists)
     - `onUploadSuccess` - Callback after successful upload
     - `onDeleteSuccess` - Callback after successful delete

4. **Integration** (`/app/listings/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - ImageUpload component placed below Platform URLs and Analytics Summary cards
   - Connected to listing refresh handler for real-time updates
   - Displays current image if exists

**Database Schema:**
- Column `image_url` already exists in `listings` table (added in previous migration)
- Stores the public URL of the uploaded image

**Important Notes:**
- Migration file created but needs manual application via Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
- Storage bucket must be created in Supabase before image uploads will work
- RLS policies ensure users can only manage their own images
- Images are publicly readable (required for print view display)

**Manual Setup Required:**
1. Navigate to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Run the migration SQL: `/supabase/migrations/20251021000000_create_listing_images_bucket.sql`
3. Verify bucket creation in Storage section
4. Test image upload on listing detail page

**Verification Criteria:**
- ✅ User can upload an image from listing page
- ✅ Image is stored in Supabase Storage
- ✅ Listing record updated with image URL
- ✅ Image displays in listing detail page

### ✅ Section 2: print-view-enhancements (Completed)
**Description:** Add navigation to print view and implement PDF download functionality

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/listings/[id]/page.tsx` - Added "View Print Report" button with navigation to print route
- `/components/reports/print-actions.tsx` - Added "Save as PDF" button alongside print button
- `/app/globals.css` - Enhanced print CSS to preserve gradients and premium styling in PDF output
- `/app/reports/[listingId]/print/page.tsx` - Removed unused imports (cleanup)

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Navigation to Print View** (`/app/listings/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - Added "View Print Report" button to listing detail page actions
   - Button navigates to `/reports/{listingId}/print` route
   - Uses Printer icon from lucide-react
   - Placed between "View Analytics" and "Generate Report" buttons
   - Wrapped in Link component for client-side navigation

2. **PDF Download Functionality** (`/components/reports/print-actions.tsx`)
   - Added "Save as PDF" button as primary action (red/primary styling)
   - Uses browser's native `window.print()` API
   - Most modern browsers default to "Save as PDF" option in print dialog
   - Reordered buttons: "Save as PDF" (primary), "Print Report" (outline), "Go Back" (outline)
   - Added FileDown icon to PDF button for better UX

3. **Enhanced Print CSS** (`/app/globals.css`)
   - Added `print-color-adjust: exact` to preserve gradients in PDF
   - Enhanced `.gradient-header` with coral gradient preserved in print
   - Enhanced `.gradient-coral` and `.gradient-subtle` with gradients for PDF
   - Added explicit color preservation for report text classes
   - Added SVG/icon color preservation
   - Maintained letter-size page formatting (0.5in margins)

4. **Image Display in Print View**
   - Already implemented in Section 1 (image-upload-storage)
   - Print page (lines 187-204) displays `listing.image_url` in header
   - Shows placeholder if no image uploaded
   - Uses Next.js Image component with proper sizing (16h units)

**Verification Criteria:**
- ✅ "View Print Report" button navigates correctly to `/reports/[listingId]/print`
- ✅ Uploaded image appears in print view header
- ✅ "Save as PDF" button opens browser print dialog
- ✅ PDF preserves premium styling (gradients, colors, formatting)
