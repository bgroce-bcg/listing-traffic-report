Create git worktrees

Usage: `/worktree <feature-name> [count]`

## Examples
- `/worktree homepage` - Creates single worktree
- `/worktree homepage 3` - Creates 3 numbered worktrees for design options

## Implementation

```bash
#!/bin/bash

worktree_command() {
    local feature_name="$1"
    local count="$2"
    
    # Validate feature name is provided
    if [ -z "$feature_name" ]; then
        echo "Error: Feature name is required"
        echo "Usage: /worktree <feature-name> [count]"
        return 1
    fi
    
    # Ensure .worktrees directory exists
    mkdir -p .worktrees
    
    # If no count provided, create single worktree
    if [ -z "$count" ]; then
        local worktree_path=".worktrees/$feature_name"
        
        # Check if worktree directory already exists
        if [ -d "$worktree_path" ]; then
            echo "Error: Worktree directory '$worktree_path' already exists"
            return 1
